# FLM Q4NX Converter

A utility for converting GGUF model files into the Q4NX format. This tool supports converting both language and vision model weights.

## Supported Models
Based on the configuration, the converter supports several model architectures, including:
- Gemma 3
- GPT-OSS
- LFM 2
- LLaMA
- Phi-4
- Qwen 2 / Qwen 2.5
- Qwen 2 VL
- Qwen 3
- Qwen 3 VL
- Qwen 3.5

## Setup

The project includes a setup script that automatically creates a Python virtual environment, installs required dependencies (like `torch`, `amd-quark`, `transformers`), and sets up the `gguf` package from `llama.cpp`.

1. Make the setup script executable (if it isn't already) and run it:
   ```bash
   chmod +x setup_venv.sh
   ./setup_venv.sh
   ```

2. Activate the environment using the provided activation script. **Note:** Always use `activate.sh` instead of directly sourcing the venv, as it also sets up necessary environment variables like `HF_HOME` and CUDA paths.
   ```bash
   source activate.sh
   ```

## Usage

The main entry point for conversion is `convert.py`.

### Help
```bash
python convert.py -h
```

### Basic Syntax
```bash
python convert.py [input_file] [output_folder] [-t TYPE]
```

### Arguments
- **`input_file`**  
  Also available as **`-i`** or **`--input`**.  
  Specifies the path to the input `.gguf` file that you want to convert.

- **`output_folder`**  
  Also available as **`-o`** or **`--output`**.  
  Specifies the destination folder for the converted output. The converter will save the generated file in this folder using the expected FLM filename, such as **`model.q4nx`** or **`vision_weights.q4nx`**, depending on the selected conversion type.  
  If not provided, the converter uses the same directory as the input file.

- **`-t`, `--type`**  
  Specifies which weights to convert.  
  Available options are:
  - **`language`** — converts the language model weights
  - **`vision`** — converts the vision model weights  
  If this option is not specified, the default is **`language`**.

- **`-f`, `--force`**  
  Forces the converter to use a specific model architecture instead of detecting it automatically from the GGUF metadata.  
  This can be useful when automatic detection is incorrect or when you want to explicitly select an architecture such as **`qwen2`**, **`llama`**, or **`gemma3`**.  
  Leave this option out if you want the converter to detect the architecture automatically.

### Examples

**1. Convert a language model (positional arguments):**
```bash
python convert.py model.gguf output_folder
```

**2. Convert a language model (flag arguments):**
```bash
python convert.py -i unsloth_gpt-oss-20b-Q4_0.gguf -o unsloth-gotoss20b-q40
```

**3. Convert a vision model:**
```bash
python convert.py -i qwen3vl-4b-mmproj-BF16.gguf -o unsloth-qwen3vl-vision -t vision
```

**4. Force a specific model architecture:**
```bash
python convert.py -i model.gguf -o output_folder -f qwen2
```
This is useful when the GGUF file metadata doesn't correctly identify the architecture or when you want to override the automatic detection.


## Step-by-Step Converting and Registering Custom FLM Models

This guide walks you through how to convert a supported GGUF model into FLM's Q4NX format, then either:

- **replace an existing installed model**, or
- **register your converted weights as a separate custom model**

The examples below use **`qwen3vl-it:4b`**, but the same overall workflow applies to other supported models.

---

### Before You Begin

Make sure you have:

- **FLM** installed on your system
- a **supported GGUF model file**
- the **FLM converter**
- the correct **conversion type** for your model family

#### Important compatibility note

Different model families expect different quantization formats. Your source GGUF file must match the configuration used by the model family under `configs/`.

For example:

- **`lfm2`** uses **`q4_0`**
- **`qwen3vl`** uses **`q4_1`**

If the quantization does not match the expected configuration, the converted model may not work correctly.

---

### Option 1: Replace an Existing Installed Model

Choose this option if you want to **swap the original FLM model weights** with your own converted weights while keeping the same model name and launch command.

#### Step 1: Download a compatible GGUF model

Download a supported GGUF model from Hugging Face or another trusted source.

Before continuing, verify that:

- the model is compatible with the converter
- the quantization matches the expected format for the model family
- you know which FLM model you plan to replace

For the `qwen3vl` family, make sure the GGUF model matches **Q4_1** expectations.

---

#### Step 2: Convert the GGUF model to Q4NX

Run the converter using the instructions from the **Usage** section of the converter project.

Provide:

- the input GGUF file
- an output folder
- the correct conversion type

The converter will generate one or more `.q4nx` files, depending on the model architecture.

For vision-language models such as Qwen3-VL, this may include files such as:

- `model.q4nx`
- `vision_weights.q4nx`

> Keep the output folder handy. You will need these converted files in the next step.

---

#### Step 3: Locate the installed FLM model directory

Find the installed FLM model directory for the model you want to replace.

**Default model paths**

**Windows**
```text
C:\Users\<username>\Documents\flm\models\Qwen3-VL-4B-Instruct-NPU2
```

**Linux**
```text
/home/<username>/.config/flm/models/Qwen3-VL-4B-Instruct-NPU2
```

> Replace `<username>` with your actual system username.

---

#### Step 4: Replace the existing Q4NX file or files

Copy the newly converted files from your output folder into the installed FLM model directory.

Replace the corresponding existing file(s), such as:

- `model.q4nx`
- `vision_weights.q4nx`

Be careful to preserve the original filenames expected by FLM.

**Recommended best practice**

Before replacing anything, create a backup of the original model folder or at least the original `.q4nx` files. This makes it easy to restore the original model later if needed.

---

#### Step 5: Start the model

Once the replacement files are in place, start the model using either of the following commands:

```bash
flm run qwen3vl:4b
```

or

```bash
flm serve qwen3vl:4b
```

If the conversion and replacement were successful, FLM should now load your custom-converted weights under the original model name.

---

### Option 2: Add a Custom Model Configuration

Choose this option if you want to **keep the original FLM model intact** and register your converted model as a **separate custom model**.

This is the safer and more flexible option, especially if you want to compare the original model with your custom version.

Before starting, complete:

- **Step 1: Download a compatible GGUF model**
- **Step 2: Convert the GGUF model to Q4NX**

Then continue below.

---

#### Step 1: Open the main FLM models directory

Locate the main FLM models directory.

**Default model paths**

**Windows**
```text
C:\Users\<username>\Documents\flm\models\
```

**Linux**
```text
/home/<username>/.config/flm/models/
```

---

#### Step 2: Duplicate an existing model folder

Copy the existing model folder:

```text
Qwen3-VL-4B-Instruct-NPU2
```

Rename the copied folder to something new, for example:

```text
Qwen3-VL-4B-Custom
```

This duplicated folder becomes the base for your custom model.

---

#### Step 3: Replace the Q4NX files in the copied folder

Inside your newly copied model folder, replace the relevant `.q4nx` files with the files generated by the converter.

Typical files include:

- `model.q4nx`
- `vision_weights.q4nx`

Make sure the filenames match what FLM expects for that model.

---

#### Step 4: Edit `model_list.json`

Open your FLM installation directory and locate `model_list.json`.

**Default installation paths**

**Windows**
```text
C:\Program Files\flm
```

**Linux**
```text
/opt/fastflowlm/share/flm
```

You now have two ways to register your custom model:

- **Standalone model**  

- **Submodel under an existing family**  

Both approaches work. Choose the one that best fits your organization and naming preference.

**Option 1: Add a standalone custom model entry**

Add a new entry under `models`:

```json
"qwen3vl-it-custom": {
   "4b": {
      "name": "Qwen3-VL-4B-Custom",
      "url": "https://huggingface.co/FastFlowLM/Qwen3-VL-4B-Custom/resolve/v0.9.22-faster-q4-1",
      "file_url": "https://huggingface.co/api/models/FastFlowLM/Qwen3-VL-4B-Custom/tree/v0.9.22-faster-q4-1",
      "size": 4000000000,
      "flm_min_version": "0.9.22",
      "files": [
         "config.json",
         "model.q4nx",
         "tokenizer.json",
         "tokenizer_config.json",
         "vision_weights.q4nx"
      ],
      "vlm": true,
      "default_context_length": 32768,
      "details": {
         "format": "NPU2",
         "family": "qwen3vl",
         "think": false,
         "parameter_size": "4B",
         "quantization_level": "Q4_1"
      },
      "label": [
         "vision"
      ],
      "footprint": 3.9
   }
}
   ```

---

**Option B: Add a custom submodel under `qwen3vl-it`**

Add a new sub-entry under the existing `qwen3vl-it` model family.

```json
"qwen3vl-it": {
   "4b-custom": {
      "name": "Qwen3-VL-4B-Custom",
      "url": "https://huggingface.co/FastFlowLM/Qwen3-VL-4B-Custom/resolve/v0.9.22-faster-q4-1",
      "file_url": "https://huggingface.co/api/models/FastFlowLM/Qwen3-VL-4B-Custom/tree/v0.9.22-faster-q4-1",
      "size": 4000000000,
      "flm_min_version": "0.9.22",
      "files": [
         "config.json",
         "model.q4nx",
         "tokenizer.json",
         "tokenizer_config.json",
         "vision_weights.q4nx"
      ],
      "vlm": true,
      "default_context_length": 32768,
      "details": {
         "format": "NPU2",
         "family": "qwen3vl",
         "think": false,
         "parameter_size": "4B",
         "quantization_level": "Q4_1"
      },
      "label": [
         "vision"
      ],
      "footprint": 3.9
   }
}
```

**Note on `url` and `file_url`**

The `url` and `file_url` fields only matter when FLM needs to fetch the model from a remote source, for example when you run:

```bash
flm pull <custom-model-name>
```

If you want that workflow to work, make sure:

- the model files are already uploaded and reachable online
- the `files` list matches what is actually hosted

In this guide, you have already copied all required model files into the local model directory manually, FLM can load them directly from disk. In that case, `url` and `file_url` can be dummy placeholder values and do not need to point to real hosted files.


---

#### Step 5: Copy the matching `xclbins/` folder

In the FLM installation directory, open the `xclbins/` folder.

If you created a **standalone custom model**, copy:

```text
Qwen3-VL-4B-Instruct-NPU2
```

Then rename the copied folder to:

```text
Qwen3-VL-4B-Custom
```

This folder name should match the `"name"` value used in your custom model entry.

> If you are using the **submodel style**, you can usually skip this step.

---

#### Step 6: Confirm that FLM recognizes the custom model

Run:

```bash
flm list
```

You should see one of the following in the output:

- `qwen3vl-it-custom:4b` for a **standalone model**
- `qwen3vl-it:4b-custom` for a **submodel** of qwen3vl-it family

If the new model appears in the list, FLM has recognized your configuration successfully.

---

#### Step 7: Start the custom model

Use the command that matches the registration style you chose.

**Standalone model**

```bash
flm run qwen3vl-it-custom:4b
```

or

```bash
flm serve qwen3vl-it-custom:4b
```

**Submodel**

```bash
flm run qwen3vl-it:4b-custom
```

or

```bash
flm serve qwen3vl-it:4b-custom
```



## Project Structure
- `convert.py`: The main CLI script for running conversions.
- `setup_venv.sh`: Initializes the Python virtual environment and installs dependencies.
- `activate.sh`: Activates the virtual environment and sets up environment variables.
- `q4nx/`: Core package containing the conversion logic, gguf tensor parsing, and model-specific implementations.
- `configs/`: JSON configuration files for supported model architectures.


## Known Issues
- The converter currently only supports either Q4_0 or Q4_1 quantization format based on the setting in config files for each model.
- For GPT-OSS:20B models, the converter currently uses the original `model.embed_tokens.weight` from the safetensors from OpenAI due to issues with Q4_1 quantization (from our experience, Q4_1 quantization messes up the quantization of the embedding layer for this model). 
  - **Workaround:** Place the [`model-00001-of-00001.safetensors`](https://huggingface.co/openai/gpt-oss-20b/tree/main) file in the root directory of this project before running the conversion for GPT-OSS. If the file is not found, the converter will print a warning and skip replacing the embedding weights.
